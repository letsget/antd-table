# Table with sorting, editing, removing functionality by Antd (AntDesign)

[View Demo](https://letsget.github.io/antd-table)

AntDesign (Antd) proved to be so much more than just a components library. It's kind of a framework where each component has its own logic and its own functions which you can use to accelerate development.
My top recommendation to everyone, a #1 choice beating mateiral ui and bootstrap.
